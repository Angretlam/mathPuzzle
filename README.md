This was a simple program built to determine all possible outcomes for a math game
Rules of the game are:
Using the numbers 1 through 10 once, fill an inverted pyramid

` _   _   _   _`
`   _   _   _`
`     _   _`
`       _`

 The final solution(s) must work together mathematically. Each triangle
 must be such that the top two numbers subtract into the integer of the space below.

 ie.

` 3   2   _   _`
`   1   _   _`
`     _   _`
`       _`

 In this game, the order of subtraction does not matter. The output should be the absolute value.

 The reason I created this game is that I've always figured there were multiple solutions.
 I had worked out other solutions with the assistance of friends, but it was difficult to go through
 all possible permutations. Using the random number generator, I can let the computer try as often as
 it wants. Enjoy, and see if you can find a way to optimize the solution finding to get quicker results!
